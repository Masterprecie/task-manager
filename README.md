# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Task Details
Create a task management app with the following features: 

1. Display a list of tasks with their names and due dates. (You will let the user input these)
2. Ability to add a new task with a name and due date. 
3. Show an empty state when there are no tasks
4. Ability to delete tasks.

Come up with a way to display your tasks and manage your state. Be creative â€¦ I am keen on folder structure, functionality and a bit of design use react
